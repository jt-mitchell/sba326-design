              I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were
              current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel
              I got every penny‚Äôs worth.

              ‚Äú I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I‚Äôve
              been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who
              had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro
              course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
              The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my
              life. Since completing the course, I‚Äôve successfully switched
              careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ‚Äù

              ‚Äú I started as a total newbie with virtually no coding skills. I
              now work as a mobile engineer for a big company. This was one of
              the best investments I‚Äôve made in myself. ‚Äù

      Jeanette Harmon Verified Graduate An overall wonderful and rewarding
      experience ‚Äú Thank you for the wonderful experience! I now have a job I
      really enjoy, and make a good living while doing something I love. ‚Äù
      Patrick Abrams Verified Graduate Awesome teaching support from TAs who did
      the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and learning from
      their experiences was easy. ‚Äú The staff seem genuinely concerned about my
      progress which I find really refreshing. The program gave me the
      confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself
      as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will
      get the personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart
      and amazing people. ‚Äù Kira Whittle Verified Graduate Such a life-changing
      experience. Highly recommended! ‚Äú Before joining the bootcamp, I‚Äôve never
      written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can
      help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a
      former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the
      program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were
      very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
      project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next
      level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I‚Äôve often
      referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent
      experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer
      after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ‚Äù
